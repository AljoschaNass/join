                <p><strong>Disclaimer: </strong><br><br><strong>Liability for content</strong><br><br> The contents of
                    our pages have been created with the utmost care. However, we cannot guarantee the accuracy,
                    completeness, or timeliness of the content. As a service provider, we are responsible for our own
                    content on these pages in accordance with § 7 para. 1 DDG under general laws. However, according to
                    §§ 8 to 10 DDG, we are not obligated to monitor transmitted or stored foreign information or to
                    investigate circumstances that indicate unlawful activity. Obligations to remove or block the use of
                    information according to general laws remain unaffected. However, liability in this regard is only
                    possible from the point at which knowledge of a specific legal violation is obtained. Upon becoming
                    aware of relevant legal violations, we will immediately remove such
                    content.<br><br><strong>Liability for links</strong><br><br> Our offer contains links to external
                    websites of third parties, over whose content we have no influence. Therefore, we cannot assume any
                    liability for these external contents. The provider or operator of the linked pages is always
                    responsible for the content of the linked pages. The linked pages were checked for possible legal
                    violations at the time of linking. Illegal content was not recognizable at the time of linking.
                    However, a permanent content control of the linked pages is not reasonable without specific evidence
                    of a violation of the law. If we become aware of legal violations, we will remove such links
                    immediately.<br><br><strong>Copyright</strong><br><br> The content and works created by the site
                    operators on these pages are subject to German copyright law. The reproduction, editing,
                    distribution, and any form of exploitation beyond the limits of copyright require the written

                    Should you become aware of any copyright violations, we ask you to provide corresponding
                    information. If we become aware of legal violations, we will immediately remove such
                    content.<br><br><strong>Data protection</strong><br><br> The use of our website is usually possible
                    without providing personal data. Insofar as personal data (e.g., name, address, or e-mail addresses)
                    is collected on our pages, this is always done, as far as possible, on a voluntary basis. This data

                    The use of contact data published within the framework of the imprint obligation by third parties to
                    send unsolicited advertising and informational materials is expressly prohibited. The site operators
